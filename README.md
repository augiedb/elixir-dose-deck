# Deck

This is code created for a tutorial for the [ElixirDose.com](http://elixirdose.com) website.  Looks like that post, in particular, doesn't exist anymore.  But the follow-up one, where I converted the Records to Maps, does.  [You can find it here.](http://elixirdose.com/post/dose_maps_migration)

There are no dependencies.  This code was created with Erland 16B02 and Elixir 0.11.3-dev

** TODO: **

Add all the functionality needed to create a card game. Game play mechanics, card comparisons, dealing out cards, etc.
